Nick Tune, author of Architecture Modernization and Staff Engineer at PayFit, joins us to explore the complex world of modernising legacy systems.

We start by reframing legacy systems as successful products asked to solve problems they weren't designed for.
Nick introduces his four-pillar modernisation framework and the concept of "Death Valley" - the dangerous hybrid state during migration.
We explore socio-technical alignment, how domain models drift from business language over time, and how team structure shapes architecture through Conway's Law.
The conversation also covers how AI tools like Claude Code are transforming architecture work through code analysis, refactoring, and living documentation.

Topics include:

- Reframing legacy as successful systems outgrowing their design
- Four pillars: business/strategy, design/discovery, architecture, execution
- Month three milestone: balancing analysis with demonstrable progress
- Death Valley: dangerous hybrid state during migration
- Semantic drift: business terminology vs code terminology
- Conway's Law: team structure mirroring software architecture
- Architecture Modernization Enabling Teams (AMET)
- Platform as product: standardisation vs developer experience
- Using Claude Code for analysis, refactoring, living documentation
- Guardrails: linting, test coverage, complexity limits for AI agents
- Multi-agent workflows running in parallel

Throughout the conversation, Nick demonstrates how architecture modernisation is fundamentally about aligning business needs, team structures, and technical systems - and how AI tools are becoming essential for understanding, documenting, and evolving complex codebases.
