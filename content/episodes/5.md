In Part 2 of our deep dive into Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Vlad Khononov returns to explore how to apply DDD in the real world.

We go beyond the foundations and into implementation - from context mapping and EventStorming vs Domain Storytelling to fit‑for‑purpose architecture and testing, team design and ownership, pragmatic adoption, and AI's impact on modelling.

Topics include:

- CQRS in practice
- Bounded contexts and subdomains: boundaries, granularity, and trade‑offs
- Context mapping patterns: conformist, ACL, open‑host, partnership, separate ways
- EventStorming vs Domain Storytelling (remote facilitation tips)
- Architecture patterns: Layered, Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)
- Implementation choices: Transaction Script, Active Record, Domain Model, event‑sourced domain model
- Testing strategies: E2E (simple flows), integration (Active Record), unit tests (aggregates)
- Teams and adoption: ownership, safe duplication (never in core), where to start, and AI's role

We wrap with how to adopt DDD without overwhelming your team - focusing on shared understanding, clear ownership, and picking the simplest tools that fit your domain today while keeping tomorrow flexible.

_This is Part 2 of a 2‑part series. In Part 1, we covered the foundations: what DDD is for, subdomains and their types, ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, and making flexible architecture decisions._
