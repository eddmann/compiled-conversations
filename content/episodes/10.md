Bruce Momjian returns to explore the internals of PostgreSQL by way of a table's lifecycle.
From creation through insertion to querying, we dive deep into how Postgres actually implements tables, indexes, and queries under the hood, revealing why understanding these internals helps you make better decisions as a database user.

We examine how Postgres handles everything from physical storage to transaction visibility.
Bruce explains why constraints are critical for data integrity, how MVCC enables consistent reads without blocking writes, and how the query planner makes decisions about accessing your data.

Topics include:

- Table creation: physical storage, constraints, and why data types matter
- Storage internals: 8KB pages, TOAST, fill factors, and how data is physically laid out
- Data insertion: write-ahead logging, transaction visibility, and durability guarantees
- Index types and their use cases: B-tree, BRIN, GiST, GIN, SP-GiST and when to use each
- Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC): how Postgres handles concurrent reads and writes
- Query planning: statistics, costs, and how Postgres chooses access methods
- Join strategies: nested loops, hash joins, merge joins and when each is optimal
- The importance of constraints and how they protect data integrity
- Sequences, transaction visibility, and dealing with concurrent operations

Bruce also shares insights into why certain design decisions were made, how they compare to other databases, and practical tips for working with Postgres effectively.

_This is Part 1 of a 2-part series. In Part 2, we'll explore the remaining lifecycle of a PostgreSQL table - including updating rows, altering table structure, row deletion, and finally dropping tables._
