Ashley Hindle, creator of Laravel Boost, joins us to explore the practical side of AI-assisted development - from understanding core concepts to implementing real-world solutions.

We start by breaking down the AI landscape, explaining how artificial intelligence, machine learning, generative AI, and large language models connect.
Ashley shares his journey from building AI-driven features since OpenAI's first API release to creating Laravel Boost, a comprehensive package that accelerates AI-assisted development in Laravel projects.

The conversation covers everything from prompting techniques and context management to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and how it enables AI agents to interact with external tools and services.
We dive deep into Laravel Boost's architecture, including its 16 MCP tools for database querying, browser log monitoring, and version-specific documentation search.

Topics include:

- AI fundamentals: understanding AI, ML, GenAI, and LLMs
- Prompting techniques: zero-shot, few-shot, chain of thought, and context engineering
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector embeddings
- LLM agents: the "fancy while loop" that powers autonomous AI systems
- Model Context Protocol (MCP): enabling AI agents to access external tools
- Laravel Boost: structured guidelines, MCP tools, and version-specific documentation
- Development workflows: refactoring, bug fixes, new features, and project scaffolding
- Testing strategies in the AI era and why tests are more important than ever
- Practical advice for developers starting their AI journey

Ashley also shares insights on the evolution from simple autocomplete to full task completion, the importance of maintaining responsibility for production code, and how to balance AI assistance with human oversight.
We discuss the challenges of context management, the role of guidelines and rules in steering AI behavior, and the future of AI benchmarking in development.

Whether you're new to AI or looking to optimise your development workflow, this episode provides practical guidance on integrating AI tools effectively while maintaining code quality and developer responsibility.
