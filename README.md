Conversations with the people shaping software and technology.

## About

Compiled Conversations features in-depth conversations with the people shaping software and technology.
Each episode explores real-world experiences, technical challenges, and the thinking behind the tools, systems, and decisions that drive modern development.
From engineering practices to architectural choices, this is a show for developers who care about how software is built - and who's building it.
